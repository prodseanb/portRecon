Essential reconnaissance tool, identifies open ports and services using the [sockets](https://docs.python.org/3/library/socket.html) module.

### Faster, more efficient
Using [threads](https://docs.python.org/3/library/threading.html) to maximize scanning efficiency.
```
Ports = 0-5000

### Identifies open/listening ports and services
```
[Hit] 172.16.101.134:53 = Open        [*] SERVICE: domain
[Hit] 172.16.101.134:80 = Open        [*] SERVICE: http
[Hit] 172.16.101.134:443 = Open        [*] SERVICE: https
[Hit] 172.16.101.134:1883 = Open        [*] SERVICE: none
```
### Scan more ports
On Linux: `ulimit -n [limit]`.<br />
On Windows, find this line and adjust the value:
```python
main.MAX_ports = 1000
```
